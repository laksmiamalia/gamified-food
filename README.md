## Overview
The Meal Plan Streamlit App allows users to input personal information like weight, height, age, gender, and activity level to generate a personalized meal plan. The app categorizes meals based on caloric intake and provides detailed options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.

## Raw Data

**Food:** The name or type of the food item. <br/>
**Caloric Value:** Total energy provided by the food, typically measured in kilocalories (kcal) per 100 grams. <br/>
**Fat( in g):** Total amount of fats in grams per 100 grams, including the breakdowns that follow. <br/>
**Saturated Fats( in g):** Amount of saturated fats (fats that typically raise the level of cholesterol in the blood) in grams per 100 grams. <br/>
**Monounsaturated Fats( in g):** Amount of monounsaturated fats (considered heart-healthy fats) in grams per 100 grams. <br/>
**Polyunsaturated Fats( in g):** Amount of polyunsaturated fats (include essential fats your body needs but can't produce itself) in grams per 100 grams. <br/>
**Carbohydrates( in g):** Total carbohydrates in grams per 100 grams, including sugars. <br/>
**Sugars( in g):** Total sugars in grams per 100 grams, a subset of carbohydrates. <br/>
**Protein( in g):** Total proteins in grams per 100 grams, essential for body repair and growth. <br/>
**Dietary Fiber( in g):** Fiber content in grams per 100 grams, important for digestive health. <br/>
**Cholesterol( in mg):** Cholesterol content in milligrams per 100 grams, pertinent for cardiovascular health. <br/>
**Sodium( in g):** Sodium content in milligrams per 100 grams, crucial for fluid balance and nerve function. <br/>
**Water( in g):** Water content in grams per 100 grams, which affects the foodâ€™s energy density. <br/>
**Vitamin A( in mg):** Amount of Vitamin A in micrograms per 100 grams, important for vision and immune functioning. <br/>
**Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)( in mg):** Essential for glucose metabolism. <br/>
**Vitamin B11 (Folic Acid)( in mg):** Crucial for cell function and tissue growth, particularly important in pregnancy. <br/>
**Vitamin B12( in mg):** Important for brain function and blood formation. <br/>
**Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)( in mg):** Necessary for energy production, cell function, and fat metabolism. <br/>
**Vitamin B3 (Niacin)( in mg):** Supports digestive system, skin, and nerves health. <br/>
**Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic Acid)( in mg):** Necessary for making blood cells, and helps convert food into energy. <br/>
**Vitamin B6( in mg):** Important for normal brain development and keeping the nervous and immune systems healthy. <br/>
**Vitamin C( in mg):** Important for the repair of all body tissues. <br/>
**Vitamin D( in mg):** Crucial for the absorption of calcium, promoting bone growth and health. <br/>
**Vitamin E( in mg):** Acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect cells from the damage caused by free radicals. <br/>
**Vitamin K( in mg):** Necessary for blood clotting and bone health. <br/>
**Calcium( in mg):** Vital for building and maintaining strong bones and teeth. <br/>
**Copper( in mg):** Helps with the formation of collagen, increases the absorption of iron and plays a role in energy production. <br/>
**Iron( in mg):** Essential for the creation of red blood cells. <br/>
**Magnesium( in mg):** Important for many processes in the body including regulation of muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure and making protein, bone, and DNA. <br/>
**Manganese( in mg):** Involved in the formation of bones, blood clotting factors, and enzymes that play a role in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption, and blood sugar regulation. <br/>
**Phosphorus( in mg):** Helps with the formation of bones and teeth and is necessary for the body to make protein for the growth, maintenance, and repair of cells and tissues. <br/>
**Potassium( in mg):** Helps regulate fluid balance, muscle contractions, and nerve signals. <br/>
**Selenium( in mg):** Important for reproduction, thyroid gland function, DNA production, and protecting the body from damage caused by free radicals and from infection. <br/>
**Zinc( in mg):** Necessary for the immune system to properly function and plays a role in cell division, cell growth, wound healing, and the breakdown of carbohydrates. <br/>
**Nutrition Density:** A metric indicating the nutrient richness of the food per calorie. <br/>

## Feature Engineering

For this dataset aside from cleaning the dataset, we've done some feature engineering, to categories some column for further analysis.
- Categorize food items by nutritional content (e.g., high-protein, low-carb). <br/>
- Generate personalized meal plans based on user inputs. <br/>
- Customizable meal categories for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. <br/>
- Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit. <br/>

## Usage

[Streamlit Link](https://game-clustering-app-fgyphhwudpyxdjxpsxstaf.streamlit.app/)

- Input your personal details (weight, height, age, gender, activity level) in the app. <br/>
- Click "Generate Nutrition Plan" to see your personalized meal plan. <br/>
- Explore the categorized meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. <br/>
- Customize your meal plan as needed. <br/>
